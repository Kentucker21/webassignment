                    My name is Keneil watson and I'm 20 years old. I'd like to think the Emotion that best describes me is 
                    wonder. Wonder about his world and myself, I instrospect and reflect on myself and things that have happened
                    to me over the years and I wonder if it all has a grand meaning or purpose or is it me 
                    who gives it purpose. I'd also say this form of self awareness is one of my strongest traits,
                    It helps me to be a better person and change the wrongs of my past. I'm not really a people
                     person I am very introverted but I am very outgoing with certain friends and people who I've taken a 
                     Liking to. My hobbies are Reading,playing guitar,watching movies and swimming and
                      I've been looking for more hobbies to add to that list.

                <h2>School life</h2>

                <p>
                     I've been enjoying my time at university so far, It's not been exactly as I expected but
                     most things in life aren't. I've met a few new friends and I am hoping to make more,
                     I'm in my second year of university and the classes are not really that hard it just takes
                     alot of time and commitment, which is something I struggle with. It's a whole new experience even 
                     if it's my second year and it still takes some getting used to being away from home .
               </p>

                A hero of mine that Inspires me would be Thorfinn, the main character of the manga 
                series Vinland saga, the story follows his journey for revenge and his subsequent 
                realization that revenge would not fix him and how he grapples and changes with that reality.
                A qoute from thorfinn, "I have no enemies". short simple and straight to the point, It shows 
                that this blood thirsty, merciless warrior has changed into a whole diffrent person.
                The reason I idolize this character is because he embodies the will to change and I want to be like that.
                A stronger,Kinder and better person.

             </div>
           

            <p>I'd say the test did a good job at 
                finding out what my personality is overall
                though it had some trouble in a free spots particularly
                the part that says I'm materialistic, I wouldn't say 
                I give off that vibe but it seems I was given it
                based on my answers so maybe I might be A ittle.
