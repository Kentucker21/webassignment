        <h2>What I've learnt</h2>
        <div class="book">

        <p>
            Upon reading the book "the twelve pillars" I've come to learn alot of valuable lessons but two of those lessons stood to to me the most.
            The first valuable lesson I've from the twelve pillars book is to think of your relationships as tilling a garden. 
            Once a flower blooms it will need water and sun to keep it from wilting. 
            Treat it with care and it will flourish, neglect them and it will surely wither and fade away. 
            Too often do I neglect my relationships, my friends, my family and my significant other, 
            I would very much like to blame it on my introvertedness and my inclination to be alone and have time by
             myself but I've been realising that in doing that I'm involuntarily pushing people away and out of my life.
              This realization has really opened my eyes to my ways and I will try and use it to be a better person towards 
              those in my life so they can bloom gracefully.
            <br><br>
            Have a goal to strive towards, this will keep you grounded and steadfast in the path ahead, 
            most likely without one you'll remain direction less and take life as it hits you, some people 
            can live like this but I choose not to, my goal is to become a software engineer and I 
            will accomplish it by any means necessary that's part of the reason why I'm doing 
            this degree in the first place, to make that dream a reality and be able to say in the end 
            "I stood true to my goals and say it through to the very end, I did it".
             The book also talks about writing down your goals to bring them into reality 
             and I've been doing something quite similar to that albeit to a smaller scale. 
             <br><br>
             I have a list of 100 things that I want to do before I graduate college and by 
             writing them down I am bringing them into reality and holding myself accountable to those goals, 
             it will not affect me if I don't achieve them but it's within the sentiment that I tried that gives me solace.
              Another quote from the book that embodies this is "make a million dollars, not for
               the million dollars but for what you will have become to make a million dollars".
            With this way of thinking I think it shows what I really want to become at the end of
             all of this, a better person, a stronger person who looks out for the weak and for 
             himself as well . To become what I envision I have to remain true to my goals and ambition,
              they are my guide. I am where I am currently at but that does not mean I need to stay there

        <h2>My Progress</h2>
        <p>
            So far In my Journey,In college Pursuing a 
            Computer Science Degree, I am currently in the 2nd Year of the degree
            and I'm feeling very confident and enthusiastic About
            whats to come and what I'm going to learn next. Learning to
            balance all my classes and assignments is starting to become
            a struggle for me so I've decided to make a calender to keep track of it for me
            and to also try and fit socializing time into that schedule.

            <br><br>
            The top 2 skills I've learned so far from my degree I'd say is 
            Critical thinking and how to code in c. These modules have really
            changed my way of thinking and how to approach certain tasks that I think hih school
            me would have trouble with. Secondly Coding in C , A base language has really
            made me have an appreciation for higher level languages and how C has paved the way
            for a whole generation of coders.
